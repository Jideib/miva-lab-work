To be done from Saturday, 26 July to Monday, 28 July, 2025

  ### What needs to be done
1\. Data Exploration Tools:  
\- **Python code: \`sns.load\_dataset('titanic')\`, \`head()\`, \`isnull()\`, \`sns.countplot()\`**

2\. Data Cleaning Tools:  
**\- Python code: \`fillna()\`, \`sns.boxplot()\`, \`dropna()\`**  

3\.Feature Engineering Tools:  
**\- Python code: \`df\['FamilySize'\] \= df\['SibSp'\] \+ df\['Parch'\]\`, \`pd.cut()\`**

4\. Data Transformation Tools:  
\- **Python code: \`pd.get\_dummies()\`, \`StandardScaler()\`, \`MinMaxScaler()\`**  

5\. Model Preparation Tools:    
**\- Python code: \`train\_test\_split()\`, \`LogisticRegression()\`, \`classification\_report()\`**  

6\. Report Writing     
\- Write a summary of what the team did (like a detectiveâ€™s notebook).    
\- Explain the steps in simple words (no confusing math\!).    
\- Show pictures of the work (graphs, tables) and say how good the model is.  

Tools:    
\- Words, graphs, and a clear conclusion\!  

How to Work Together:

1. We need to work together simultaneously via Github, so everyone drops your Github account username and Ibraheem Alawode will create a repo.  
2. If needs be, we might just have to do a crash class on Github collaboration  
3. We need to pick this task and do the coding  
4. We are writing with Latex and we will all be editing it together.  
5. Kindly pick any of the tasks below and Two people can pick one task.

1\. Data Explorer starts (Task 1).    
2\. Data Cleaner fixes missing/weird data (Task 2).    
3\. Feature Inventor and Data Magician work together (Tasks 3 & 4).    
4\. Model Trainer builds and tests the model (Task 5).    
5\. Storyteller writes the final report (Task 6).
